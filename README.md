I did some self teaching earlier this year so luckily I already had something to stand on.
I feel pretty comfortable with variables, functions, and objects (including nesting multiple objects).
I have had a lot of practice with if/else statements and switches and Im good with the logic it just takes some time to think about.
Now loops.... I hate loops lol it is very confusing to me but I find that using console log at every step helps me work out where i have a mistake and im not getting the output I expected. 
Im leaving a lot of my thought processes in the comments so you can see how I got from point a to point b
